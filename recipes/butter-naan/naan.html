    <p>Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened bread that is stuffed and flavored in a variety of ways. An essential part of South and Central Asian cuisine, naan is easy, affordable, and makes the most of pantry ingredients you already have on hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>

        <br><br><li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
        <br><li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
        <br><img src="step3.webp" alt="Step 3" height="250" width="330">
        <br><br><li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <br><img src="step4.webp" alt="Step 4" height="250" width="330">
        <br><br><li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <br><img src="step5.webp" alt="Step 5" height="250" width="330">
        <br><br><li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br><img src="step6.webp" alt="Step 6" height="250" width="330">
        <br><br><li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
        <br><li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
        <br><img src="step8.webp" alt="Step 8" height="250" width="330">
        <br><br><li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
